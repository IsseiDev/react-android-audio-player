For many new developers, this process can seem unwieldy so here's a cheatsheet that aims to explain the full stack. \r\n\r\nAlthough React Native offers an [excellent tutorial](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/android-setup.html) on setting things up, the purpose of this document is to explain the stack in a way that makes sense to new developers.  \r\n\r\nSetting up React Native for Android on a Mac\r\n-\r\n####Step 1 - Package Mangers\r\nSince we're on a Mac, we'll first need to install the package managers required to download the tools we'll need.  \r\n- [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/)\r\n- [Node Package Manager](https://nodejs.org/en/)\r\n\r\n####Step 2 - Java\r\nSince Android is built on Java, we need to install Java on Mac and the Development Kits\r\n\r\n- [Java Development Kit (JDK)](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html)\r\n\r\n- [Java for OS X](https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1572?locale=en_US)\r\n\r\n####Step 3 - Android\r\nNow that we have Java installed, let's install Android Development Kit\r\n\r\n- Install Android SDK using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh)\r\n\r\n```\r\n brew install android-sdk\r\n```\r\n\r\n####Step 4 - React Native\r\nSince React Native is a JS framework for building app on Android, let's install it using [Node Package Manager](https://nodejs.org/en/) \r\n\r\n- Install [React Native](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-cli) using [NPM](https://nodejs.org/)\r\n\r\n```\r\n npm install -g react-native-cli\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Step 5 - Install Watchman\r\nThe React Native team recommends you do this in order to avoid a strange bug.  \r\n```\r\n brew install watchman\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n####Step 6 - Android Emulators\r\nWhile doing development, you'll need an Android emulator to test our of your app.  Let's use [Genymotion (free edition)](https://www.genymotion.com/) as our Android emulator. \r\n\r\n1. Install [VirtualBox Emulator](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) then **reboot your computer**. \r\n2. After your computer is rebooted, then install [Genymotion](https://www.genymotion.com/#!/download) for an Android emulator\r\n\r\n####Step 7 - Configure your Mac's environment variables\r\n\r\nFirst create a file for your home environment variables using Terminal [Screen Grab](http://snag.gy/3oawd.jpg)\r\n```\r\n nano ~/.bash_profile\r\n```\r\n*You can also use ```vi```, ```mate``` or your prefered editor. I just just believe ```nano``` is great for new devs.*\r\n\r\nPaste this snippet into ```~/.bash_profile``` [Screen Grab](http://snag.gy/JeSUO.jpg)\r\n```\r\n # If you installed the SDK via Homebrew, otherwise ~/Library/Android/sdk\r\n export ANDROID_HOME=/usr/local/opt/android-sdk\r\n```\r\n\r\n####Step 8 - Download more packages for Android SDK\r\nThis will likely change often so be sure to check up and see which versions of Android you'll need to build for React Native.\r\n\r\n- Read [Android Setup for Reach Native](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/android-setup.html#configure-your-sdk)\r\n\r\n####Step 9 - Install a Debugger for ReactDevelopment\r\nOnce you start working on your first React Native app, be sure to install the Google Chrome Debugger.  It will save you tons and tons of headache.\r\n\r\n- [React Native Debugger for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi)\r\n\r\n####Optional\r\nSome developers like to use an IDE to write code\r\n- [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)\r\n\r\n### Resources for streaming radio\r\n- [React Native Audio Player](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-audioplayer)\r\n- [React Native Audio](https://github.com/jsierles/react-native-audio)\r\n- [Build a streaming audio app with React Native](http://www.oreilly.com/pub/e/3483)\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n[@chrismendezinla](https://twitter.com/chrismendezinla)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
